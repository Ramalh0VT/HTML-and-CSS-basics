# Main description
This is a repository so i can enhance and save my HTML/CSS projects and learn more about it. You will find here websites varying from very simple websites to very complex and functional ones! 
    
## html folder
This is the folder where i started to learn html again, remembering alot of stuff i forgot. Here you will mostly find simple websites, but some more complex stuff may appear.

## css folder
Here things get more complex than on the basic html folder, this is where i save more complex things

## scrapped project folder
I was developing my biggest css and html project here, but i didn't really see reasons to continue developing it since it will be more of a "grunt force" type of labor to me

## Quick note
Ever since i had clear vision of what i wanted to do regarding programming, i don't see any reason to keep contributing to this repo, so it might get abadoned soon (though i will still be active on github)
